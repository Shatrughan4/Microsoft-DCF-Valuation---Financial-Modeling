# Microsoft-DCF-Valuation---Financial-Modeling

## **Introduction**

This project focuses on **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**, a fundamental financial modeling technique used to determine a company's intrinsic value. DCF analysis is widely applied in **investment banking, equity research, and corporate finance** to assess whether a stock is fairly valued.

This case study evaluates **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)** using **DCF valuation**, incorporating **financial forecasts, risk assessment (WACC), and intrinsic share price estimation** to support investment decision-making.

## **Understanding DCF Valuation**

The **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model** estimates a company‚Äôs intrinsic value by forecasting future free cash flows (FCFs) and discounting them back to present value using the company‚Äôs cost of capital.

### **Key Components of DCF Model:**
‚úÖ **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The cash generated by a business after accounting for operating expenses and capital expenditures.  
‚úÖ **Discount Rate (WACC):** The rate at which future cash flows are discounted to present value.  
‚úÖ **Terminal Value:** The estimated value of the company beyond the forecast period.  
‚úÖ **Enterprise Value (EV):** The total value of a business, including both debt and equity.  
‚úÖ **Equity Value & Share Price:** The final intrinsic stock price derived from the valuation model.

## **DCF Valuation Process**

### **1. Projecting Free Cash Flows (FCF)**
- Forecasting FCF for **5-10 years** based on revenue growth, operating margins, and reinvestment needs.
- Utilizing historical financial statements to estimate future performance.

### **2. Calculating WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**
- **Formula:**
  
  ```math
  WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1 - Tc)
  ```
  
  Where:
  - **E/V:** Proportion of equity in capital structure.
  - **D/V:** Proportion of debt.
  - **Re:** Cost of equity (calculated using the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**).
  - **Rd:** Cost of debt.
  - **Tc:** Corporate tax rate.

### **3. Estimating Terminal Value**
- **Using Gordon Growth Model:**
  
  ```math
  TV = (FCF_n * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
  ```
  
  Where:
  - **g** is the perpetual growth rate.
  - **FCF‚Çô** is the final projected free cash flow.

### **4. Discounting Cash Flows to Present Value**
- Future cash flows and terminal value are discounted using WACC:
  
  ```math
  PV = FCF_t / (1 + WACC)^t
  ```

### **5. Calculating Intrinsic Share Price**
- **Enterprise Value (EV) = PV of Free Cash Flows + PV of Terminal Value**
- Adjusting for debt and cash to get **Equity Value.**
- **Fair Share Price = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding.**
